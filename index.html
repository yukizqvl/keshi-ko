    <p>Hello, Keshi! I don't expect you to talk to me. I just ask for a little of your time—to read what I've finally found the courage to write. It's okay if you don't read it now... or ever. But if you do, please open it when you're ready.</p>
    <p>I hope you'll give me that chance, even if it's too late. After all, better late than never.</p>

    const text = `Hi, Keshi ko.

It’s been months since I left, and everyday since then has felt empty... without you. I’ve carried this weight silently, afraid, ashamed, and unsure of how to face you—or even myself. I should've spoken sooner, I should've fought harder, I should've loved you the way you deserved. But I was too weak. And in my weakness, I lost you. I let go of the one person who stayed no matter what, who understood me in ways no one else could, who loved me for who I am and more than I probably deserved. And that person was you.

I keep thinking about us, about everything we shared, and the pain of knowing I let it slip through my fingers never leaves me. What we had was real. I loved you so deeply—more than I knew how to show, more than I knew how to fight for. But loving you also meant not letting your gentle, pure soul sink into the same misery I was drowning in. So, I let you go. Not because I wanted to, but because I didn’t want to keep dragging you into my storms. I loved you. And yet, I walked away. I left you without explanation, without closure, leaving you to wonder, and for that, I am so, so sorry. I wish I could take back every moment I made you feel alone, every time I faltered when you needed me the most.

I see you now, and I can’t tell you how it feels—part of me wants to run to you, to beg for another chance, and part of me knows I don’t deserve it. I see your smile, your happiness, the way life seems to embrace you, and it hurts in a way I can’t describe. You deserve all of it. You deserve love, care, joy, happiness—everything I couldn’t give you because I wasn’t strong enough to stay. And I’m glad you found it, even if it’s not with me. I would never want to take that from you. 

I lost myself back then. I let fear, immaturity, and my own pain cloud my heart. I let you go because I thought I was protecting you from me, from my chaos, from my failures. But in reality, I was only protecting myself from facing the truth—that I was too cowardly to fight for the person I loved the most. And now, the truth burns inside me every day: losing you is the deepest regret of my life. You were everything anyone could ask for—kind, gentle, understanding, beautiful inside and out... and I let you slip away.

I know you might be thinking that I’ve moved on, or that I’ve found someone else, or that you already know how things ended. But that’s not the case. The person you might have seen me with was just a collaboration for fame—nothing more. We acted like a couple, but we weren’t, and even trying to do that while I was still yearning for the love of my life—you—was completely wrong. I know it hurt you, I know it shattered your heart into pieces, and I am truly, deeply sorry for that. I never meant to cause you pain, and the thought of betraying your trust in any way still eats at me every day.

Do you remember when I asked about your favorite month and day? September, because of the -ber months, and 24 because of 11:11. That was supposed to be the day I would court you properly. I even wrote it all down, days before, and kept it in my notebook. But I failed. I failed to give you the love you deserved, failed to fight when I should have fought, failed to stay. And for that, I am endlessly sorry. “Sorry” doesn’t begin to cover the pain I caused you, the guilt I feel for letting you down, for being too weak to stand beside you when it mattered most.

I saw you moving on, or at least I thought so. You disappeared offline for weeks, and I felt my chest tighten with longing and fear. I missed you so much it was unbearable. But I stayed silent, thinking it was better for you to forget me, better for you to heal without me in your life. I never even considered moving on myself. It has always been you, always. And seeing glimpses of you, your little posts, your memories of us… it filled me with shame and sorrow I can’t describe. Hiyang hiya ako sa lahat ng nagawa ko. The thought of asking for you again feels almost impossible, too bold, too selfish.

Yet I have to write this. You deserve it. You deserve to hear the truth: that everything I did, every mistake I made, every moment I faltered, came not from a lack of love but from weakness, fear, and immaturity. I never stopped loving you. I never stopped thinking about you. And even though I hurt you, even though I lost you, that love has never faded.

I am proud of you. I am proud of the person you are now. Seeing you happy fills me with a mixture of joy and heartbreak. I am happy for you—truly—because that is all I’ve ever wanted for you. To see you smile, to see you thrive, to see you loved the way you deserve. I would never interfere with that. I would never be the one to take that light away from you.

Until the day our paths cross again, if they ever do, I will carry this love, this regret, and this sorrow with me forever. Losing you, letting go of you, has been the deepest, most painful lesson of my life. I loved you, Neri. I love you more than I can express, more than I could ever show. And you know that.

Please, take care of yourself. Be gentle with your heart. Stay in love, and live fully, as you always deserve. Be happy for me, mkay? I will keep praying for your happiness, your safety, and your peace—always. You'll forever have a special space in my heart, lovelove.

Always and forever, Mikmik`;
